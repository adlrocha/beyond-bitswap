# Beyond Bitswap Testbed
This repo implements a testbed to evaluate the performance of different IPFS exchange
interfaces. It is currently used in the scope of the Beyond Bitswap project to test
improvement proposals over the base code.

The repo is conformed by the following parts:
* [testbed](./testbed): It implements a Testground test environment and a set of python scripts to run the tests and process the results.
* [probe](./proble): A simple CLI tool that comes pretty handy to test new implementations and debugging purposes.

You will find additional documentation in these directories.

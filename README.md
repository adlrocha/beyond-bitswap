# Beyond Bitswap Testbed

This repo implements a testbed to evaluate the performance of different IPFS exchange interfaces. It is currently used in the scope of the Beyond Bitswap project to test improvement proposals over the base code.

For the full project description, please consult [BEYOND_BITSWAP](https://github.com/protocol/ResNetLab/tree/master/BEYOND_BITSWAP)

The repo is conformed by the following parts:
* [testbed](./testbed): It implements a Testground test environment and a set of python scripts to run the tests and process the results.
* [probe](./probe): A simple CLI tool that comes pretty handy to test new implementations and debugging purposes.
* [datasets](./test-datasets): Add in this directory any of the datasets you want to use in your tests.

You will find additional documentation in these directories.
